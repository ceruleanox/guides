## Ddos Distributed Denial of Service Attacks

A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make a resource (e.g. site, appilcation, server, network) unavailable or painstakingly slow to legitimate users by overwhelming the target with traffic or sending information that can trigger a crash. Instead of being attacked from one location (Denial of Service attack), multiple systems orchestrate a synchronized DoS attack to a single target.

There are many types of DDoS attacks. The most common attacks include:

<ul>
<li>Traffic attacks: Traffic flooding attacks send such a high volume of TCP, UDP and ICPM packets to the target that legitimate requests get lost. These attacks may also be accompanied by malware exploitation.</li>
<li>Bandwidth attacks: This DDos attack floods the target with tons of junk data, resulting in a loss of network bandwidth and equipment resources and can lead to a complete denial of service.</li>
<li>Application attacks: Application-layer attacks target items like DNS services, HTTPS and HTTP. By depleting resources in the application layer, the target's system services become unavailable.</li>
</ul>

The distribution of hosts that defines a DDoS attack enables attackers to:

<ul>
<li>leverage the greater machine power to execute a major attack</li>
<li>mask their true location due to the random distribution of attacking systems (often worldwide)</li>
<li>pose a bigger challenge to overcome (e.g. need to shut down multiple machines instead one)</li>
<li>disguise themselves behind many (mostly compromised) systems, making it harder to identify them</li>

While no one can completely protect against DDoS attacks, one can prepare for, react to and recover from DDoS attacks by assessing risk and building a resilient network â€” one that combines architecture and procedures to limit the possibility and effects of systemic failure.
